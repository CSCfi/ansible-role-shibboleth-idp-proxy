    Define entries here to map error messages returned by external modules and classify them as particular
    kinds of errors for use in your templates and as events in flows.
    
    The examples here just allow external signaling of the exact type of condition to record.
    
    If you want to "fall-through" to other login flows, include a mapping to "ReselectFlow".
